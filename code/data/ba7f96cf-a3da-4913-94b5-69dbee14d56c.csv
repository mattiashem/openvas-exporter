A possible recursion was detected during CGI scanning:

The service is using a relative URL in one or more HTML references where e.g. /file1.html contains <a href=""subdir/file2.html""> and a subsequent request for subdir/file2.html is linking to subdir/file2.html. This would resolves to subdir/subdir/file2.html causing a recursion. To work around this counter-measures have been enabled but the service should be fixed as well to not use such problematic links. Below an excerpt of URLs is shown to help identify those issues.
